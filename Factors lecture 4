Write a program that takes a number as input and prints all its factors except 1 and the number itself.. If the number has only two factors (1 and the number itself), then the program should print -1.
Input Format :
A single integer, n
Output Format :
All the factors of n excluding 1 and the number itself
Constraints :
0 <= n <= 10,000
Sample Input 1 :
8
Sample Output 1 :
2 4
Explanation of Sample Output 1 :
The factors for the number excluding 1 and itself are 2 and 4, so the output is 2 4.
Sample Input 2 :
11
Sample Output 2 :
-1
Explanation of Sample Output 2 :
11 is a prime number having factors 1 and 11 so that output will be -1.

Code:

import java.util.Scanner;
public class Solution {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Write your code here
        Scanner s=new Scanner(System.in);
        int n=s.nextInt();
        int i=2;
        boolean a=true;
        while(i<=n/2){
if(n%i==0){
    System.out.print(i+" ");
    a=false;
}
i=i+1;
        }
if(a){
    System.out.print("-1");
}
    }
}
