code:

import java.util.Scanner;
    public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
       Scanner s=new Scanner(System.in);
       String str=s.next();
       char ch=str.charAt(0);
       if(ch>='A'&&ch<='Z'){
           System.out.println("1");
       } 
       else if(ch>='a'&&ch<='z'){
           System.out.println("0");
       }else{
           System.out.println("-1");
       }
